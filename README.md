# DDA-SKF
DDA-SKF model is proposed to predict drug-disease associations, which can be summarized in three steps:
(1) Three drug similarity kernels and two disease similarity kernels were obtained; 
(2) the Similarity Kernel Fusion (SKF) algorithm was used to integrate these similarities into two comprehensive similarity kernels; 
(3) the Laplacian Regularized Least Squares (LapRLS) framework was used to build the prediction model.
All data and code will be introduced in different folders.
